# Neural Network

A three layer neural network implementation that learns through a feed-forward network followed by backpropagation. The number of hidden layers is determined in the call to the constructor of the network. The number of hidden neurons can be varied along with the learning rate and momentum (constants in neural network) to modify how fast and how well the network fits itself to the training data.
